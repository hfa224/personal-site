		<summary><i>What did I use?</i></summary>
		<p>I based the styling on <a href="https://css.winterveil.net/">magick.css</a> and <a href="https://moku.blog/">moku.blog</a> (a lot cuter than this) and used <a href="https://darn.es/link-peek-web-component/">link-peek</a> (with some changes to the JavaScript) to make the link data refresh when the link is changed.</p>
		<p><s>And then I realised the link-peek javascript wouldn't work where I wanted to upload this, so I ditched it
			and went back to using some simpler javascript that just displays an image I uploaded and text I wrote for each site.</s>
		</p>
		<p>Actually, I did get it work by importing it differently! I then uploaded as a bunch of html, css, image and js files to <a href="yay.boo">yay.boo</a> and made some minor tweaks (updating file paths) to make it work. And that's it.</p>
