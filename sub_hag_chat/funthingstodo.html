				<summary><i>What did I use?</i></summary>
				<p>I based the styling on <a href="https://moku.blog/">moku.blog</a> (a lot cuter than this) and <a
						href="https://darn.es/link-peek-web-component/">link-peek</a>, with some changes to the
					JavaScript
					to make the link data refresh when the link is changed.</p>
				<p><s>And then I realised the link-peek javascript wouldn't work where I wanted to upload this, so I
						ditched it
						and went back to using some simpler javascript that just displays an image I uploaded and text I
						wrote for each site.</s>
				</p>
				<p>Actually, I did get it work by importing it differently! I then uploaded as a bunch of html, css,
					image and js files to <a href="yay.boo">yay.boo</a> and
					made some minor tweaks to make it work. And that's it.</p>
