			<h2>Hags Surf the web</h2>

			<div class="image-aside" style="width: 60%">I can't kick my instagram habit, but I've been trying to replace
				the websites I browse to be less - horrible? I've tried
				hacker.news but the users seem to be the most pedantic humourless bunch ever (hello software devs). But
				you can find fun stuff like <a href="https://tidings.potato.horse/2024-07-15/aethelred">this website</a>
				that gives you current affairs in the style of Mediaeval poems, and <a
					href="https://drawing.garden/">emoji gardens</a>.

			<p>This is working because it's inspired me to make my own static websites, which is a better use of my time
				than sitting
				on my phone probably? I've made a static site <a
					href="{{ url_for('sub_hag_chat') }}">here</a> to show you random links to stuff I've read recently as an
					example.

			<h2>Hags do Pilates</h2>

			I also tried out a pilates class and was introduced to the pilates reformer, a terrifying machine we did all
			sorts of things with.

			<h2>Hags Horror Summer</h2>

			<p>This month we've seen <b>Maxxxine</b> and <b>Longlegs</b></p>

			<p>I've been thinking about horror hype - how a film can never be as scary as you want or as good as you
				want. Maxxine's neon 80s dream is ultimately unsatisfying because she's not a bad enough bitch. Longlegs
				could never live up
				to it's hype, although I found it's beige detective noir satanic panic creepy wacky thrills fun enough.
			</p>

			<h3>Texas Chain Saw Massacre</h3>
			<p>I'd never seen this film and they were playing it at the old IMAX so I had to go - on a sunny hot day.
				There was a disappointing turn-out. We had a talk beforehand,
				There's so many iconic shots in this film and it's so bleak, but there's also a reading of it as a dark
				comedy - just like life I guess! Sally is one of the all-timer final girls ðŸ’•
			</p>
			<blockquote>"It's all about a very bad day. I mean, it's a bad day for everyone. It's a terrible day for
				Leatherface. Leatherface, he keeps wondering where the hell all these kids are coming from, and to the
				point where he goes and sits down by the window and looks out and then he starts patting his face
				because he knows his ass is in such terrible trouble."
				<footnote>- Tobe Hooper, in 'A History of Horror with Mark Gatiss' (2010)</footnote>
			</blockquote>
			<p>My enthusiasm is undaunted however, as here are other films slated to come out I'm still excited for
				<b>Cuckoo</b> (Aug 2024), <b>I Saw The Tv Glow</b> (July 26th) and <b>Alien Romulus</b> (16th August).
			<p>It's weird because don't really think of myself as a horror fan? I always thought Beth and I could do one
				of those podcasts where the horror nut introduces their scardy cat friend to scary films, but when we
				talked about it Bethany was like <i>Helen, you love
					horror movies! You're literally always watching them!</i> And I guess that did happen at some point.
