		<h3>About me</h3>
		<p>I climb, watch <a href="https://letterboxd.com/Bluebottles/">a lot of films</a>, enjoy reading and have a 
			<a href="https://playful-fox-d178c6.netlify.app/">bookclub</a> with my friends, and like taking 
			<a href="{{ url_for('photos') }}">photographs</a>. I really love a crossword. 
			I also dabble in life drawing, get sucked into the occasional video game and journal almost every day. 
			I run a <a href="https://just2hags.substack.com/">newsletter</a> with my friend Bethany.</p> 
		<p>I work as a consultant at a software company in Bristol, and do a bit of coding and a bit of management.</p>
