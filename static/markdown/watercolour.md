# Watercolour course day 1

* Pencil sketch first -> 2b pencil, very light

## Sky

* Creamy on damp wash
* Mix up a grey colour (umber and <span class="colour cobalt-blue">cobalt blue</span>)
* Two coats of damp with the big brush
* Don't go back once it's dry

### Backdrop hills

* Wet on dry
* Can start dark then drag out with wet brush
* Leave bits of white as detail
* Or start light and then build up

### Notes

Mistake I made was too much creamy paint on sky - no white bits left, created muddy mess.  
Second mistake was too wet - it went grainy.

### Sea

* Drawing and layering - less wet initially, leave dry bits for
   "sparkle" on water"  
* Go back and layer dark on top to pull both sections together.
* Section at the bottom (where waves are rough)    pressing the brush
   on paper, us the whole brush loaded with paint to    get shapes
* Put diff colours on brush (loose mixing) and roll

## Watercolour week 2

More colours
Landscape with pinks and orange

### Sketching

* Use pencil for angles and distance
* No need for any detail

#### Painting the sky

* <span class="colour raw-sienna">Raw sienna</span>, <span class="colour permanent-rose">rose</span>, <span class="colour cobalt-blue">cobalt blue</span>
* Tempting to use yellow -> but when it mixes with cobalt blue it goes muddy so NO

1. Dampen the sky
2. Light <span class="colour raw-sienna">raw sienna</span> wash - immediately add <span class="colour permanent-rose">rose</span>
3. Bigger shape higher up / smaller shapes by horizon

#### Painting the heather

Same colours -> Use ‘creamy’ colours and brush work -> ‘tapping’ on paper

1. Dampen the heather section
2. Little brush -> <span class="colour cadmium-yellow">cadmium yellow </span> on top edge
3. Using a separate brush, <span class="colour permanent-rose">rose</span> underneath -> melts in -> goes orangey
4. Keep going down, dabbing on <span class="colour permanent-rose">rose</span>
5. Drifts down onto path -> add some upright dabbing
6. Add in shadow on bottom edge using 
    <span class="colour sap-green">sap green</span> -> run into the <span class="colour permanent-rose">rose</span> (Layering -> light now, can add darker later)

#### Next bit of heather

1. Top edge -> yellow and raw sienna (raw sienna wash underneath)
2. Pat rose across on top
3. Again use blue and sap green to add shadows

### Watercolour week 3

Drawing and painting poppies -> using botanical drawing for reference

Pencil sketch -> then pen -> rub out the pencil

* Solid line vs broken line
* Not too concerned w/ accuracy

Use a water/fade proof fine line marker (0.4)

#### Colours

Cobalt blue, rose, cadmium red
(Cadmium red = cadmium yellow + rose)

#### Petals

1. Blue for outer rim, run into rose (NOT into cad red, as makes it dirty) then add cad. red to rose.
1. Cobalt blue + rose = violet ( + sap green to make greyer) is good for shadows
1. Wet each petal individually and add paint. The pen allows very wet, looser style of painting as structure given by pen.

#### Notes

1. Some bleeding
2. Ended up going more precise -> not leaning into looser style much

## Watercolours week 4

Seascape

#### Drawing

1. Use measurements and markers to get things in the right place. Angles etc.

2. Use side of pencil, helps to keep lines light.

#### Painting the sky

1. Graduated wash of cobalt blue and turq / phalto blue. Wet the paper -> load the brush at the top of the paper. Wipe the brush off (little bit of pigment left) wet again and pull it down to the mountain.

#### Sea

1. Top bit turquoise / bottom cobalt blue. Dry painting -> scratchy brush, sideways to try and get the “sea sparkles”. Get the edge of the wave in (leaving it white).

#### Mountains
  
1. Violet -> cobalt blue and rose wash. Leave gap for green between mountains and sea (and white gap between green and sea).

#### Notes

I struggled with the rocks -> cobalt blue and burnt sienna wash over the whole beach -> this gives cooler brown that becomes grey the more blue you add.
Pick the rocks out using darker shade of the same colour. Use shadows of rocks to pick out other rocks.
